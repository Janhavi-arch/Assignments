Psychology is the study of how and why people behave as they do, including their mental processes, personality, and social interactions.
                Social psychologists study how people's thoughts, feelings, and actions are influenced by the presence and behavior of others. They research social interactions and the factors that influence them, such as group behavior, attitudes, public perceptions, and leadership. Social psychologists also study social challenges, such as prejudice, implicit bias, bullying, criminal activity, and substance abuse.

            <p>
                Behavioral psychology, or behaviorism, is a theory suggesting that environment shapes human behavior. In a most basic sense, behavioral psychology is the study and analysis of observable behavior.There are several opportunities for integrating behavioral psychology into practice. For instance, many psychologists research topics like conditioning to examine the nature of human behavior. Often, they are able to apply findings to mental health disorders.

                Behavioral psychology has had a major impact in clinical applications. For instance, mental health counselors, substance abuse counselors, and other professionals use therapeutic techniques from behaviorism to help people overcome specific issues. Even newer fields, like applied behavior analysis, have emerged by adapting concepts from behavioral psychology.
